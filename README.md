# Predictive-Modeling-for-E-Commerce-Customer-Churn
Aim: proactive customer retention
Brief Overview: Customer churn prediction project using ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost). Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning. XGBoost achieved high Recall, PR AUC, and F1 Score. SHAP analysis explains key churn drivers. 

This project demonstrates the process of predicting customer churn using various machine learning techniques. Customer churn, or attrition, is a critical metric for businesses as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By building a predictive model, businesses can proactively identify customers at risk of churning and implement targeted retention strategies.

The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:
1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
3. Model Building and Evaluation (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines)
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Model Comparison and Selection
6. Model Interpretation (SHAP Analysis)

The goal is to build a model that effectively identifies customers likely to churn, with a focus on metrics like Recall, Precision-Recall AUC, and F1 Score, especially important for imbalanced datasets.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle: E-commerce Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction. It contains various customer attributes and a target variable indicating whether a customer has churned.
