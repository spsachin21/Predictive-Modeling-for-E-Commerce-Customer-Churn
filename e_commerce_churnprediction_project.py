# Customer Churn Prediction

**Developed by Maryia Snarava**

This notebook demonstrates the process of predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. **Customer churn** is when customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn can help businesses take proactive steps to retain customers. Throughout this notebook, we'll go through the entire machine learning pipeline, including data exploration, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

 My approach is as follows:

1. I'll start with **Logistic Regression** as our baseline model. Logistic Regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm for binary classification problems like churn prediction. It's a great starting point as it's easy to implement and interpret.

2. Using **Logistic Regression**, I've achieved an accuracy of **81%** in predicting customer churn. And **Recall**: 0.85, **PR AUC**: 0.721, **F1 Score**: 0.60.

This serves as our baseline performance.

3. Then, using **Feature Engineering**, I've improved this model.

4. Then I did **Hyperparameter Tuning** using  grid search and have improved this model.

3. Then I experimented with more advanced algorithms with hyperparameter tuning to improve upon this baseline:
   - Decision Tree
   - XGBoost
   - Support Vector Machines

4. Then I compared all model metrics and chosed the best one.
By comparing all models to our Logistic Regression baseline, I'll be able to assess get the beter performance.

As results on best model on test set I get **Recall**: 0.95, **PR AUC**: 0.977, **F1 Score**: 0.954. Accurancy is 98.462%.

For this notebook I used a dataset from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction).

"""## 1. Introduction


### What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. In the context of this analysis:

- Churn occurs when a customer cancels their service or stops using a product.
- It's a critical metric for businesses, especially in subscription-based models.
- High churn rates can significantly impact a company's revenue and growth.

### Importance of Predicting Churn

Understanding and predicting churn is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Revenue Retention**:
   - Existing customers are often more profitable than new ones.
   - It's typically more cost-effective to retain customers than to acquire new ones.

2. **Customer Lifetime Value**:
   - Loyal customers tend to make more purchases over time.
   - They may also upgrade to higher-value products or services.

3. **Predictable Revenue**:
   - A stable customer base leads to more predictable revenue streams.
   - This can be particularly important for investor relations and financial planning.

4. **Upselling and Cross-selling Opportunities**:
   - Long-term customers are often more receptive to additional products or services.

5. **Targeted Interventions**:
   - Identifying potential churners allows for proactive measures to retain them.
   - Personalized retention strategies can be implemented before a customer leaves.

6. **Feedback and Improvement**:
   - Understanding why customers churn can highlight areas for product or service improvement.
   - It provides insights into customer preferences and pain points.

### Choosing the right metric for model

In the context of our model, correctly identifying customers likely to churn (**true positives**) is particularly important because it allows the business to take timely action. **False negatives** (failing to identify customers who will churn) represent missed opportunities to retain valuable customers and the associated revenue.

While it's also important not to misclassify loyal customers as potential churners (**false positives**), the cost of reaching out to a satisfied customer is generally lower than the cost of losing a customer who could have been retained with proper intervention.

This is why I will use metrics that emphasize the correct identification of churners instead of accuracy.

To create model, that correctly predicting the churned customers I am going to focusing on these metrics:

- **Recall**: This is crucial as it directly measures how well we're identifying churned customers.

- **PR AUC**: This gives a good overall picture of performance on imbalanced data.

- **F1 Score**: This balances precision and recall.

## 2. Data Loading and Exploration

Here, I'll get a better understanding of dataset. First, I load the customer dataset:

### Interpretation

An accuracy of 85.2% indicates that our model correctly predicts whether a customer will churn or not in 85.2% of cases. While this is a solid performance, there's still room for improvement. It's important to note that accuracy alone may not be sufficient to fully evaluate the model, especially if the dataset is imbalanced. Wwe can see, that f1-score is only 0.65. It meens, that we can trutly predict only 51% of customer who are going to churn.

### Limitations

1. Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the features and the log-odds of the outcome, which may not always hold true in complex real-world scenarios.
2. It may not capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data.
3. The model's performance might be affected if there are strong correlations between independent variables.

I think that is all that we can get from logistic regression, so let's try advanced algorithms, that could potentially yield better results for this classification task.

## Next Steps
To improve the model and gain deeper insights, I could suggest the following steps:

- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Conduct a deeper analysis of feature importances to understand key drivers of churn.
- **Deploy the model**: Create a REST API using Flask or FastAPI and deploy it to cloud providers.
- **Explainability**: Consider using techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to understand how the model makes predictions and build trust in its outputs.

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The SHAP library was successfully installed and used to calculate SHAP values for the XGBoost model's predictions on the test set.
*   A SHAP summary plot was generated, visualizing the overall feature importance based on the distribution of SHAP values for each feature.
*   SHAP dependence plots were generated for selected important features, illustrating the relationship between the feature values and their impact on the model's output (SHAP value).

### Insights or Next Steps

*   Analyze the generated SHAP summary and dependence plots to identify the most influential features and understand how they affect the model's predictions.
*   Use the insights from the SHAP analysis to potentially refine the model, engineer new features, or explain the model's behavior to stakeholders.
